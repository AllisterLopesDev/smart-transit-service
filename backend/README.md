🚀 Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
📌 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS)

npm
 (comes with Node.js)

Git (optional, if you’re cloning this repo)

⚡ Installation

Clone the repository (or download as zip):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo.git
cd your-backend-repo/backend

npm install

⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend root and add the following (adjust values as needed):

PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword


⚠️ Don’t forget: .env is in .gitignore so it won’t be pushed to GitHub.
